# JS Practice Problems

A collection of my approaches and solutions to various practice problems from leetcode and AI prompts

## Notes

In practice problems, I can get in the habit of seeing and implementing recursion. 
In more complex problems, or real life I can not. I need to learn to see them better. One advice is
```
The clearest signal to know when to use recursion is asking: does solving this problem require the answer to a smaller version of itself?    
"Can I describe the answer to f(n) using f(smaller input)?" 
```
